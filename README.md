## PaletteAnalyzerKey
Adds a keyboard shortcut to analyze the palette of world.
The sorted palette is written to the tiles.txt file. 
Which is needed to create art.
The mod was created based on the QS(Quick Save) mod.
## Notes
The first time you click on the shortcut button, a configuration file with four lines is created. Subsequent clicks will not recreate the file. In the file, you need to add key values (after >), namely, maximum tiles and paths to Exceptions and to Torches.
  ```json
      MaxTile X> 200
      MaxTile Y> 1100
      Torchs path> C:\ARTs\torchs.txt
      Exceptions path> C:\ARTs\exceptions.txt
  ```
