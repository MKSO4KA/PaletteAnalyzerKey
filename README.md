# PaletteAnalyzerKey
Adds a keyboard shortcut to analyze the palette of world.
The sorted palette is written to the tiles.txt file. 
Which is needed to create art.
The mod was created based on the QS(Quick Save) mod.
## Note
**At the end of the mod (a white inscription about tiles.txt in the game chat), _we must move tiles.txt to a directory one level higher_(on this directory C:\ARTs)**.
